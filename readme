This project has been a fantastic opportunity for me to explore the functionality of the HTML form element and various inputs for user interaction.
A particular challenge was implementing custom validation and styling for the forms, overriding the default browser styles. 
Additionally, a key goal for me was the design aspect of this project. 
I utilized neural networks for image generation and experimented with interesting design solutions. Hopefully, the outcome is visually appealing.

Functionality:
- Page loading animation
- Styling of inputs on input and when errors occur
- Show/hide password functionality
- Select element
- Form submission if all inputs are correct (even though it goes nowhere)
- Other design solutions

P.S. The theme and the login "boburkurwa2003" are dedicated to my friend, who is also involved in web development. 
It's a friendly joke, as his name sounds similar to the word "bober" from a well-known meme. 
Just in case it seems strange :)
